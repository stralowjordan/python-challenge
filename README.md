# python-challenge
pybank & pypoll

In this project I used Jupyter Notebook while coding with Python and Pandas. 
We were instrcuted to take to large sets of data, one being fictional finanical statements from a made up company, the second be being election results for a made up town.
The financial analysis and the election result analysis are avaliable with the running of the code I created.
You will see the results in an analysis folder in said project.
You will see the csv file I used for each part of the project under the resources folder in said porject.
